# Induslnd-Hackathon-2019 Prototype
Fintech Hackathon 
``This is the prototype project made on the problem statement Induslnd Hackathon 2019 organised by Techgigg``

* In this project I have given more importance to Aadhar Number which is the users unique id and Account number linked with the Aadhar Number at the time of register.

* User must enter only the account number that is registered with the Aadhar Number, otherwise the user can not perfom any transaction.

* As it is the prototype of lite user transaction application, so duplicacy of Aadhar number is not allowed , otherwise all the data in the data in the database will be modified and updated when duplicate Aadhar number is used again to register. This could be one drawback and this gives us an idea that this duplicacy will not be allowed in real application which can create a problem
